## TL;DR: 
### C# files from last year are hard to access, so any code that I do access will be uploaded as proof of my work last year, as well as code I've written recently.

##### :
My C# Files from last year are rather hard to access, I'm unable to view the code within each file until I go through an extensive process.
I will seperate basic / bad code from code I believe to be more so impressive or "higher level" when compared to the basic stuff.

The code will also include stuff I've done more recently.
